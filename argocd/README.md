# argocd

Argo-related content lives here: GitOps scaffolds, demos, and other Argo CD examples.

- `gitops-environment-example/` – Kustomize + Argo CD scaffold with appsets, per-env overlays, addons (Istio, kube-prometheus-stack, External Secrets, Trivy), and app-of-apps bootstrap for dev/prd clusters.
- More Argo CD materials will be added over time (dashboards, policies, pipelines, etc.).
