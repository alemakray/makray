# argocd

Argo CD/GitOps assets I use to show how I manage multi-cluster environments.

- `gitops-environment-example/` – Kustomize + Argo CD scaffold with appsets, per-env overlays, addons (Istio, kube-prometheus-stack, External Secrets, Trivy), and app-of-apps bootstrap for dev/prd clusters.
- More Argo CD examples and experiments will be added here over time.
